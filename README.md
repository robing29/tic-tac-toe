# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe game in JavaScript, written for testing git and my programming skills

Working version of the game

to be done:

clean up code, trying to shorten the functions (Halfway there);
- replace alerts with css classnames
- display proper gameover message
- proper styling and design
- table bigger, but still have square cells
- Animate GameOver Text: Kreis gewinnt!

done:
- use button to reset the playing field
- Choose starting symbol (2 Buttons, onclick verschwinden beide)
- change mouse cursor to kreis or X
- Fields now are field with CSS crosses and circles

ideas:
- play against randomized computer?
- play against randomized computer who always chooses mid-first?
