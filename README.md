# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe game in JavaScript, written for testing git and my programming skills

v.1 and probably final version of the game

- Features:
- Resizable table, with squares as cells
- Table always centered
- Customised Mouse Cursor depending on game state

Things that I got to know through this project:
- Bootstrap 4
- Scope of functions
- Nested functions
- array.every()
- GIT

Things that I learnt the hard way:
- My GIT workflow is not well established yet
- Hiding divs is better than hiding their content, because the content may change in the future.

ideas:
- play against randomized computer?
- play against randomized computer who always chooses mid-first?
- play against online-player?
