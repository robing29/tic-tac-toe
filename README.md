# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe game in JavaScript, written for testing git and my programming skills

Working version of the game

to be done:

- clean up code, trying to shorten the functions (Halfway there);
- replace alerts with animated gameOver Texts.
- display proper gameover message
- proper styling and design
- table bigger, but still have square cells
- add media queries, so that the table looks good everywhere
-> Bootstrap this shit!

- GameOver mit alerts umsetzen? Billige Variante (Auch billig: MIt Toasts)
- On big screens: Display buttons beside playing field
- On small screens: Display buttons below playing field, but zoom towards it

done:
- use button to reset the playing field
- Choose starting symbol (2 Buttons, onclick verschwinden beide)
- change mouse cursor to kreis or X
- Fields now are field with CSS crosses and circles

ideas:
- play against randomized computer?
- play against randomized computer who always chooses mid-first?
- play against online-player (on robingu.de);
