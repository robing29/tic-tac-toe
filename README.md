# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe game in JavaScript, written for testing git and my programming skills

Working version of the game
// Not necessary? Next: Trying karl's idea of an array and checking a1.hit etc. against aktuellerSpieler == 1 or 2

to be done:

clean up code, trying to shorten the functions (Halfway there);
- replace alerts with css classnames
- display proper gameover message
- proper styling and design
- table bigger, but still have square cells
- Animate GameOver Text: Kreis gewinnt!

done:
- use button to reset the playing field
- Choose starting symbol (2 Buttons, onclick verschwinden beide)
- change mouse cursor to kreis or X
- Fields now are field with CSS crosses and circles
