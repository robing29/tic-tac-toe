# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe game in JavaScript, written for testing git and my programming skills

Next: Trying karl's idea of an array and checking a1.hit etc. against aktuellerSpieler == 1 or 2

for (let i = 0,i < 9,i++>){
    array[i].onclick = function (){
        doEverything(array[i])
    }
}

adopted hungarian notation for variables.

to be done:
clean up code, trying to shorten the functions
replace alerts with css classnames
display gameover message
display button for restarting the game
use button to reset the playing field
Choose starting symbol
